# Goal
The goal of this project is to determine the likelihood of whether a customer will accept a coupon given to them based on their demographics, their contextual attributes at the time the coupon is given, and the actual coupon group itself. I selected the coupon group of Restaurants with average expense of under $20 as this was one of the biggest groups of coupons given or offered. There is an opportunity to target the coupons to certain demographics and attributes to maximize the acceptance rate.
# Approach
I used a two-stage approach, first exploring the data by each attribute to try to narrow down to the biggest drivers. Then I explored the data using combinations of attributes to determine if there are any strong combinations of attributes that are more likely to cause a higher acceptance rate.
